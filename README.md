# Algo-Checkpoint
this is my first readme file created to explain more about the algo file 
the algorithm read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and determine:

The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.

just keep in mind that:
Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.
